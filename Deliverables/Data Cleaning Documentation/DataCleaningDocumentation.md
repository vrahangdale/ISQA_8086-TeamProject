## This file specifies the steps taken by the team to clean the dataset for various questions- 

 ## 1. 1–2 paragraph text description of the data source/s (how much, where from, what it contains, etc.) with a properly formatted citation for each data source. This should include how many rows & columns (&/or tables) and sample column headers.
 ## 2. Specifically identify any intellectual policy constraints, or lack thereof (licensing).
 ## 3. 1 paragraph description of the metadata: what information is available to help you interpret and understand the data?
 ## 4. Identify any issues you have encountered with the data: missing values, unstandardized content, entity matching, etc.
 ## 5. 1 paragraph description of your rationale for the steps you’re taking to remediate data. For example, if you need to fill in empty fields, specify what value you chose and why.
 ## 6. A script or step-by-step textual description (or a combination) that documents your data cleaning process with enough detail for replication.
