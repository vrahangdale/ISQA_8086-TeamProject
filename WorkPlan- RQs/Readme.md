## 1. Introduction of StromEvent Data set

<<<<<<< HEAD
The NCEI Storm Events Database contains various types of storm reports searchable by state, county, date, and event type from 1950 to the present. Data are also available in comma-separated value (CSV) files, as entered by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).

## 5. Target Audience 
  * Climate data is used by scientists in their research and analysis of past, current, and future climate change. But today, the information is also  commonly used by the policy makers to make informed strategies to prevent and adapt to climate change, and the scientists also recommend the increased availablity of data to public to reduce their vulnerability to climatic changes.
